Hey! ---> let's continue our research towards a brave new world ---> got really excited yest (emot and physics)
Last nights hipothesis were not to be considererd ---> also remember Joe satrian ---> it's like a remembering journey^^
Mention time calculation? ---> checking 1820s (XIX cent) ---> already did 27 bc/ac
Still thinking in DCarapeto ref ---> can be 1) his last name, 2) jordan/tennis related or 3) fucking will (just kidding) 
Some questions:
  1. Does it include an actor or a movie/serie character? --->
  2. Does it have any relation with Italy? ---> some breaking bad refs could lead to gustavo fring /pollos hermanos / giancarlo esposito + faceoff, as example
  3. What would be the final number of person/names to mix up?
  
  

*Would you like to receive some img surprise? ðŸ˜ˆ ---> don't know in which context you are rn ---> guess that PT center or AT
