Godzilla ---> it the character that most fit the descriptions
    ---> includes all the previous monsters discuss "fusion" ref ---> actually king of monsters 
    ---> also ---> crztrain album ---> lizzard ref maybe ---> gaerea means us, so I can understand as a mix of us ---> fish+gorilla lol
    ---> and its a movie (several, actually)
    
Am I getting close?



Loudst animal on earth ---> sperm whale + cachalote (meaning big head) ---> 
    Sperm oil ---> latex
    Head ---> oil + biggest head
    Echolization sounds ---> 

Maybe its a mix of beasts? 


Well ---> there is another king of the jungle that is really big and loud --> kingkong ---> match some refs
    ---> researching it rn


Ok ---> think it is loud then ---> there is specifics about frequencies and ratios, but it is super technical for me lol
ah, and still have to check the remainig sfy refs


Think got the idea that this bigfoot/tarzn lead is the way forward ---> maybe merge, remixe and/or search for combinations
Also ---> sound refs ---> loud sound/echo? ---> make sense due to previous refs ---> Dj + metal ---> (could be interpreted as hot or heat, but dont think so)

The last post ---> think you're telling to explore the intelectual part of this recent discoveries ---> make sense, but I'm figuring out where to begin

*quiz question for you ---> Do you know one of the meanings of falujah in urban dictionary?^^

--------------//----------------------------


Hey, mate! ---> Yesterday tried prompts with Tarzn and son ---> exploring if I'm missing something that I should add :)
Maybe was too fast making the transition ---> from bigfoot to trzn ---> checking history and other prompts that could do
