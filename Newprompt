Pter <3 ---> didn't say anything cause been studying the histories ---> my best guesses since there are a match btw characters/actors --->
   1. ElijaWood ---> not only Lotr, but also other movies (mainly one about machines and robots) + personal history
   2. Viggo ---> also other movies and their histories + personal hx ---> but it is not a boy, albeit being a king
   3. Ian ---> match lot of refs but don't cover them all
   4. Search fom Sam ---> there are some refs ---> didn't try prompting yet (the previous ones did with different combinations)
   
Besides this ones ---> there is the elfs ---> but even them don't match all the refs
Couldn't cover all the beggining of tolkien world --> continuing today

Confess that yesterday at some point just got very confused ---> but found a lion shape and named award ---> venice filme festival
