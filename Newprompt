GM, bro! ❤️
Lets do this final step

------//-----
Based on the rules, I'm thinking about:
   1. The name ---> some hints point for fictional names Jane Ives, others to real name ---> also some variation like bobbybrown
   2. Where to comment ---> in owl ---> code pages or tmbl account chat or as a comment

-----//-----
Ok ---> real name :)
Now will comment in the tmbl chat maybe ---> following the rules

Thats it ---> think I comment in all accounts;) 
Ok, there's something more ---> figuring out your hints
I can comment further, maybe in code pages? There are 2 differents ---> exploring

----------//--------
Understand that is something related to space / sun ---> searching now
You answer me, right?
I'm here trying to find you ---> should i be more clear in the answer? ---> think I'll reply to your message

--------//-------
Gotta identify myself ---> update description + sending direct message
Oh, maybe it is not this then ---> thought that interjections ref in ral were related
thinking about Father ref
