Ui, also found more clues in site ---> noeydeer
Plus ---> based on law is metal ---> the kids story the sword in stne

Maybe I'm getting far away ---> but its interesting

Just realized ---> Nverland ---> dreamworld ---> maybe cross ref with Pterpan + child who don't grow up ---> hot or cold?
Maybe I should imagine that world ---> how can it be


Quick comments:
conf posts ---> can be 1) alx ref, 2) something happening tomorrow or 3) something that you really like, but still ---> exploring first
checking SF map ---> always finding new stuff ---> but this time SanPetr Rock + SanPtr vally ---> might have a connection there + post name Ptr

Working on other posts + sfy ---> the combination execut + prist + kill ---> think is something ---> at least the second one


*The ones about the book market + abandoned places ---> looks like a message to life schedule than to this worldgame ---> am I wrong?
         ---> initially thought as a ref to LoL 

will come back to you asap <3


[*burning right now cause of you ---> ouff ---> my mental thoughts]


Been exploring monarchy ---> charles (means freeman) + thrcrown + victoria period ---> plus link with Filipe from spain ---> they really are correlated
Think already said it ---> but as now saw alx hashtag ---> I did found an coloss account a bit weird ---> all based on alx
         Based on my previous question about mail submission ---> think I misunderstood ---> you might trying to say that you were answering yestarday's questions
 
Gjira album ---> the link ---> tree img ---> could be a link btw everything too!
 
Continuing research <---



*the excitment for your feed^^ + excelent spfy refs 

Head ---> working on understanding ---> clear connection
Bgcat ---> pantera ref ---> nice 
About the world ---> portal for a new world? // island with lotr aspect // might also be sun and sea like Icarus ---> really inspiring :)
     Plus SF ---> home ref maybe
Thinking about cars post ---> + Queen/King (there is something about royalty) ---> don't think is elio ref ---> could be sndman 
Funny --> search for yamcst this morning ---> to cross check some ref
About subscrition ---> also revisited blufish account yesterday ---> is it a mention for mail submission? ---> don't think so, but 

Long answer, sry ---> Will integrate more now



Hey! ---> hope you are ok ---> sharing some thoughts first cause you're fucking awseome (\m/)

About life ---> just fyi
   1. Honestly ---> I really feel you and wish I could do something to support ---> I understand the tremendous difficult position that you are in
   2. I usually don't face it ---> but please don't think that I don't care about you both ---> I share the fear of transformation
      2.1 However ---> I am slightly condident that eventually in time it will be understood

About our game
   1. Exploring yesterday posts ---> including the twi ones ---> I think capture an "head" ref
   2. Focusing on boss nva + lotr + metal/CA
   3. If it is possible ---> keeping question about bgcat ---> think one of avatar is related
