First own poem ever comoposed (fxk, never thought) ---> not near fantástico, buut proud ---> you made me like this;;


Under the normal life 
There are symbols
We are the new fire in the sky
The Redemption made us

Music as the main vehicle
Survival and destiny made the rest
By your name I fall
For your name I would die





THE BOOOK!!! What!! 



Como antes -- damias matasio ^^ (cheesy as here)

.My, understanding:
1.	Kill just happened or to be happening anytime soon [rainbow + “know allowed to play” refs] ---> assuming coming back this week ---> then, resurrection
2.	Next week Vacations-related info [today’s housing refs] ---> you might get involved somewhere ---> the boys don’t tell anything
3.	Keep strong ---> here always to support the path ---> \m/
4.  Going out to dinner ---> pass by to feel the presence ^^



PS ---> got nice content when interested;
