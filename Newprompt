Hi, bro! Checking your posts now ---> Nice hints!
 
Voldmort? ---> in this 5 characters, clearly there is One from HP

About heavy metal ---> think would be another hero + baskhero ref

Something related to Cars? ---> maybe yours
Whisper ---> understanding as a way of talking ---> yes, a spell

Excelent hints! 
Think maybe referring to human form ---> tom riddle

In order to help you ---> we have already 3 characters identified ---> Lee+yoda+Gandalf
The other two I think are ---> Tom riddle + Freddy Mercury
Not sure about Freddy but didnt give you time to assess it, too
