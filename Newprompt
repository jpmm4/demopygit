aaaandd ---> when are you arriving, then?
There is so much strong info here ^^ ---> I'm learning more and more abt the relations and accnts ---> bear with me, this still is a big world :)

hm ---> figuring out this last reflexion ---> meanwhile reading the topic about glimpse of us song
Oh, found out that Preec is oli

Think your yes and reactions means that it did happen then! ---> assuming it was very recently cause birthday
Also ---> 48h + 10th means the day of arrival ---> remember that you mention mom's birthday, but don't know when is it

Who is dream?? 
Please ---> continue your post series ---> for part threee ❤️❤️

What does flek means? ---> maybe Oli can explain better
Think there is a hint in the disease rp ---> figuring out^^

Should I get VIP ? ---> I don't mind to pay for it ---> cause there is more advantages
Also ---> it is possible to pay for changing my age ---> if it is worth it
