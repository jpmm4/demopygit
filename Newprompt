GM, bro!! <3 ---> how are you? You got up early today
I got up listening to a major bloodywood, wasnt expecting ---> they were really strong and loud ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¥µ 

Hehe ---> waiting for my PC updated and going back to WoX

-----//------
Was revisiting messages ---> and I see all of these refs to alone/ break up --->
---> I was just confused by timing ---> but, maybe, did it already happen?

aaaandd ---> when are you arriving, then?

There is so much strong info here ^^ ---> I'm learning more and more abt the relations and accnts ---> bear with me, this still is a big world :)
