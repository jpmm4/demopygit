Good morning, luff!!! ❤️❤️ Did you get enough sleep?
When are you leaving? :) I got dentist today!
   ---> maybe tmr! You'll have a great time, and hope it will be and awseome experience!!! 😉😉
*don't know if its placebo, but feeling goood! Maybe the big hazard that I faced was the fact that I started to feel lonely. There is a quote from that movie "two popes",
where Ahopkins says that he never felt alone, but started to feel lonely, and I saw myself in that position. Now, I'm learning to share it, as it is the best feeling in
the world, especially with our SO. Also, as the movie "into the wild". The other thing that I'm learning is how to beloved, once I never really felt it. Fam and friends
love is smt that I understand, but as I didn't have comparison, think it faded along the time. Yesterday read a post about the fact that if everyone is always battle and
hiding their emotions, and it was soooo important to understand the meaninig behind it! Well, in this context, I really hope that ur ok. We have been focusing in me, but
I think you're way more capable to cope with all the adversities. But PLEASE don't feel retracted just to not triggering or bothering me, cause that will never happen.
PS: we are amazing and I'm really excited for taking this journey with you, my bloodbrother <33333
