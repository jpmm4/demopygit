Not sure about the idea, but so far:

1. New network API platform ---> API.sounds
2. Will share here the org id ---> 'child_org_id' ---> João_Magalhães-cc35c3e1
3. Will explore sharing options with this API

Miscellaneous:

1. Please give us feedback regarding direction and understanding
2. Another idea pop up from prompts shared ---> traveling?
2.1 Just gently checking this mental model

Sharing_from_heat
Hoping that will be seen (available for couple hours):
  Confidence is now at 95% that an undercover link exists ---> Oh yeah!
  Going through professional uncertainty ---> trying to see what fits better at short term (most likely Paços + car + self apartment in Port)
  Would like to know (in order to emot prepare) if long vacations will still happen in the current status ---> and if we are meeting only in september or earlier
  Nevertheless, will be here when daydream comes ---> some days are good and some are bad, but feel you many times, bro!
  Sometimes it is not easy to understand or to communicate clearly through present lines (understand the necessity) ---> so, pardon if some messages are misunderstood
  Albeit understand that is not ideal, any content sharing would be highly appreciated ---> keeps physical and mind connected (.p)
  Do what have to do ---> might not understand everything now, but sure that have your reasons. Keep strong and many thanks for the brilliant feedback and engagements!
