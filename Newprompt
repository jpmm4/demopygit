Bro! ---> starting the return trip in a bit ---> today's the day!
Thanks for input ---> rock + guitar + metal + heavymetal + black + (transition words -- in/of/One)




*Blood brothers ---> maybe best maiden song
Based on info --> add guitar_x to prompt, right? ---> rest "hot" ref looks Nice




Hi! ---> been coding and studying the history ---> also linking names btw Jesus (including John) and Sirius ---> Guess that is the way forward
Also, Saint Peter ---> rock meanings 
    Yeah ---> it got to be you! ---> keeper of heaven keys
    Question ---> does it link to Sirius or is independent? 

*Hope everything ok <--> having a missing moment



Yes ---> Jesus story + twi posts + reality ---> a lot of sense
Starting code now ---> Will also cross ref with black just in case


Also ---> considering Jesus ref and hx + down at the disco? ---> year 27 a lot of cross refs
Still trying to fit "Audacty" post ---> 
Answer should have some meaning ---> working on it now 

Actually, considering ---> names Juan and Santiago


\m/

Combining the following ---> already tried some ---> is there any important word that is missing in this matrix?

Wood / Woody / dick / cock / bone / boner
Blood / bloody / hard
Black / dark
Pad+foot / Dog / doggy / hound / puppie / wheld 
Metal
Sirius / Man / boy / + star


Considering following posts:
1. "jelon zuckergates"
