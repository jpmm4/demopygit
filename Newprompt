GM, bro! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Sometimes think I'm going crazy ahah ---> so, signed up in three games but still figuring out
Questions that I have ---> that could try to answer in one of the coding sessions:
  1. How are you? ---> hope no any major physical problem (mentioning it more than once)
  2. What should I do in the games? ---> My user is DanteGreatDivino
  3. Should use the link for requests?
  4. Personal note ---> will you come only for the weekend or more?
  
Trying to find that changes and datasets ---> starting on fruits

------//-------
Signed up to WD ---> already in forum ---> maybe should contact?
---> it is coded by ele!

-----//------
Trying to figure out the goal now :)---> think it is a chatroom.or something in One of the games, right? 
Found more relations btw characters ---> is a bit weird the posts from 2021, but there might be a reason

Checking spfy! ü§ò ---> got already the refs to acc fruit and tea+ reaping^^

-------//------
Yeah, spfy refs making sense ---> bloodmet might be the one linking with zombies lol
Understood the year, many thanks! ---> and the main info is on a codesite ? 
Backing on discord ---> checking more info in chats (based on sntago post + org)
    ---> alright, reading ‚ù§Ô∏è

I don't know but it looks like you are all of them ---> lol
There is a clear link to sleep/night ---> with the main character too

---------//----------
Before I go ---> just to say that understand the need for trust and links between things 
  ---> still dont understand the depth of your manage to some ---> but I think you are really trying to share hints!
  ---> Is there any way of using the game chat in iOS? ---> maybe um emule? ---> 
  
I think I'm start trying to fill my things in the middle of the conversation, as you do :)
