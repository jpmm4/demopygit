Good morning, bro! ❤️❤️❤️
*Dude, I wanna improve myself and I understand that I can do it, also with your support. I aknwoledge the problem that I have for a very long time and the maze 
that I'm into, and the first thing that I need is to start liking myself. I think that I'm not used to be praise by someone, especially by the one I love, and I wanna 
be able to fully love you and let you fully love me. There is a lot of changes that I need to adress, and ssri meds would be a first good push to move up! The fact 
that I care (sometimes too much) and overthink things make me go into a negative spiral, and I need to adjust that too. As uknow, I've had quite traumatic events this
year, and I think was never able to cope with the uncertainty. So, I want to overcome this lack of motivation, taking new risks and embrace a new life :D that is indeed 
my new situation! I'm really gratefull for having you and I really thank you for having raised awereness, forcing me to take responsability and keeping me in check. 
I guess a partnership is all about this, too :) At last, it took me a long time to start sharing and fully opening my heart to you, but I'm feeling more empowered to 
do it, each day. Thank you very much, I love you so much! <3 
P.S.: I might start to do more sharings like this from now on, maybe I'll create a different file for that, as a reflextion space ehehe
