GM, bro <3
Will continue to interact in the different plats 
---> there is a link to the newsletter that maybe should explore

Also ---> if the timing for answer yes on tmbl is on purpose ---> can't wait and, as a horn teenager, can't hide the excitment^^ 


--> HB to R + and to you for the thousand follow

-------//------
Deep diving into the world --->
There's my wheel ❤️

Will post some questions here in a bit :)

--------//-------
Ok, I was banned from WoP ---> does this mean that you are not running it? ---> or I just screwed up? lol

Honestly, Im processing ---> feel it a bit confusing ---> there might be something more but i trust you
Anyhow, Im back on WoP with different name and on the others ---> this time Will follow the rules and dont overshare lol

-----//-----
Ok, think you are some of the accs with interaction but not all ---> that would justify the banning 
---> anyhow, understand that need time to learn the rules 

Basically, you already know what I want to know :)

If you meant the response for me (?) ---> I caught thursday + xmas^^

Quick questions/reactions:
  1. Should I do the quests in all worlds? ---> begin with the other one and am cointinuing
  2. Even not being the most correct, at some point will I receive "gif" from you? ^^
  3. If you are the great god running all the sites and characters ---> can tell me, I will always keep the credits and the roll play :)
  4. On personal note ---> assuming that both going together to Marcs wedds
  5. Oh ---> there is often pregnancy refs, there's nothing to care about, right? haha
