*listening "stairway to heaven" ---> heart; tribute


No luck yet ---> from previous Tui_lik (there is one: "just add 17 new libraries" that captures the meaning) + ral ---> looks like it ---> but can't find it ---> will keep searching
so stupid ---> time lag might just be so frustrating for you haha



Update ---> lot of things making sense ---> spanish language + LoTr references + rezzu + "lab" ---> maybe its nothing 
but continue to sense something ---> that might started 2 months ago and I've been missing ---> will continue researching ---> updating later


So, rn:

Searching for 1) user or 2) repo or 3) commmits that might match a serie of names ---> trying different ones based on previous info ---> mainly proxying spanish language
Hope I'm getting somewhere ^^
