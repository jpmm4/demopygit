from last post ---> not sure ---> maybe that the code is getting better
   This app (aud+city) and artist town+snd ---> got me previously think on writing of the usar ---> but too far thought
*hope we could see each other before the next 2 weeks

getting back to prompting :)



Alright! ---> three first small answers ---> "rule no3" maybe
Now ---> mix everything:
 1. Siris ---> Padfot
 2. SaintP ---> Rock
 3. Machinehead / blackmore (man in black lol) ---> focusing on guitr
 
 


So ---> Gave a step back ---> looked for albuns released in 72
Found severals links and hints btw artists ---> one interesting album ---> machine head + guitarrist blackmore
Cold or hot? 



Update --->
1. Language ---> ES or ENG?
2. Coding type ---> also trying your user type ---> One + "name" + in + "object" (considering guitar as object)
3. "Name" Word adaptation ---> related to dick, right? and metal ---> using rock/Stone (Saint Petr nicknames + ES variants - roca, piedra, pelota) + Simon
4. Whel meaning ---> still trying to understand
5. Expecting app code inside account




Bro! ---> starting the return trip in a bit ---> today's the day!
Thanks for input ---> rock + guitar + metal + heavymetal + black + (transition words -- in/of/One)
