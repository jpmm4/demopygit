Update: using black / dark in Tolkien languages ---> and mixing it with the names


focusing on gandalf
Working on mixing words ---> and did not exclude colours ---> might be [name] the black, as example
Names ---> childoon or young age ---> Maia character ---> olórin?
      ---> mirthandil ---> 
      ---> incanus ---> north-spy
 
  this is the process that I'm using ---> but feeling that is more than this 



<***


-----------------//---------------------

Back to prompt gandalf related words
The third rule ---> "missed" word means probably an object ---> probably the rings

My interpretation:
    Head / body ref ---> could be the ravens too
    No colour (song from destr) ---> wire = metal
Also ---> there is the X ref + pentagram

But most important: Odin god story is the one that should follow? ---> cause don't want to get away from gandalf, if not necessary
    He has a all zoo linkage ---> + pentagram song - sign of wolf ---> relates to it
    
**XOXO to you too 🤘🤘

-------------//--------------------

Chcking gandalf origin Odin ---> (thor's father) ---> he has a lot of names ---> also Mimir story but think it is too far

-------------//---------------------

Santiago ref ---> pilgrim ofc lol
Whistle ref ---> it is when he calls the shadowfax, don't know
about the design combo ---> been using just the words black and dark ---> reviewing your posts ---> hell might be another option?

-----------------//---------------

GM ❤️ ---> hope you liked my single!

Didint find it :/ ---> but I think Im getting there
Still have Gandalf names to search ---> and think got the mixing / remixing idea
    As an example ---> white rider + black ---> blackrider
    Is this the way or mixing characters? ---> as galadriel + Gandalf

Oh, found that the name Gandalf comes from nordic dwarfs names ---> That explained a lot^^
Couldnt yet find link with capital letters ---> Will continue to work hard on find you today
    



Working hard on Gandalf ---> names + combos with black / dark /


The ref on jazz links to bass, right? ---> which might lead to small / Little
Already list all main characters of both movies + the rings of power ---> now making crosses based on posts

I remember that we were assign each a character of the fellowship ---> but don't remember who lol

*First single of the new album comes out today ---> ready to come out

-----------//----------


Forget the previous question ---> the mostly tonight should be the ones you talk ---> keeping on Gandalf and galadriel
Also ---> errors type should mean alpha and beta, I guess

Dwarfs, is it a race I should looking into? ---> been neglecting them





Hey, mate <3 ----> thanks for the questions, think Im picking them up
Traveling now from Leiria ---> thinking while driving

The posts + spfy from last week and half should be enough, right? ---> cause sometimes I confuse myself with refs from too long ago

*about me ---> so I leave to austria on sunday for a week
Im applying for PhD during the Next 2 months ---> london, NL, NO and USA
If london / EU ---> there is a chance to start earlier in the research center in january


---------//--------


About the name ---> is it something like blackgandalf? ---> music + lotr characte
(Is it a wizard, right? Not a darkforce trooper) ---> better, is it someone that appears in the moria scene? (+ Mirthil ref)
Is there a relation with face / mask ---> does he use its on the movie? 

Thinking about which of us was identified and with what character

In soudtrack ---> there's a song called samwise the Brave

*Not going to sleep today while I don't find you ---> have to concentrate :)


-------//------

Ok, then! ---> I want to find that goldmine^^
Lotr then ---> but with a caveat of embedding / merging something
    ---> focus on gandalf / galadriel / sauron (=darkforces)
    ---> also the shape matters ---> maybe an animal (dog / cat) or the eye / ring
    ---> in the box think it's important ---> keep thinking if santiago isn't bics related too
---> checking the capital letters in the redwood account ---> always seemed odd the way you chose to capital them
---> python feature ---> maybe is the language of the account
---> the tonight post, might mean a recently update or account creation?
---> umnunumnabo was an hint?

**just excited ---> for your words + last night visions ---> fit + thick ❤️
safe for work share ---> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109976267/191467730-7a575119-fdca-4b5a-9ec2-6be6e27263da.jpg

Also, you're so hot 🔥🔥🔥 that I almost can't deal with it ---> "what is not dead may never die"

Us, dude ---> being honest ---> I'm really happy for you and your achievements ---> you must be a star among your colleagues and friends!
    ---> what I most fear is to loosing you during this time ---> while I don't have many "space", I'll keep fighting for you
    ---> As I understand, in the winter/xmas we will be able to be finally together ---> I wanna be there for you :) ---> and end this avoidment behaviour that we need to have
    ---> I know that you're not postponing ---> and that you have your reasons ---> but seeing you both keep living your lives, sometimes it's very hard
        ---> at last, you are both going to Marcia's wedding, right?
    ---> You have my unconditional heart + mind + soul ---> that's it! :)
    
About the game 
    ---> gandalf/lotr are on the table again ---> posts + yesterday's refs ---> could you post another close ref to it?
    ---> applying to real life situations (+santiago)
    ---> sometimes the bnomal related posts ---> suggest to focus a problem a day ---> but I think that is not the content that you are sharing in this posts
           ---> will continue to consider the search for your account
