Sooo ---> you’re arriving tomorrow ---> Oh yeah!! ---> based on comments, assuming that we will be able to see each other ---> great fcking news!

Think that “win vista” ref might be related to my processing time ---> haha nice way to put it ---> maybe comes from my previously understanding mistakes 
Buut well ---> what I think (hope^^) based on info ---> “single + stay some days here + go on vacations con nosotros”


PS.: Hope like the first part of the ep ---> the only one that I had confidence to do such thing;
