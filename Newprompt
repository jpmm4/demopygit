Couldnt find yet :/ ---> trying Multiple combinations
    1. Considering football ref to foot in "padfoot"
    2. Music considerations ---> name "metal" + "sndman" as blackman or blackhound
About context ---> the only link that found for year was James Pottr quidich plaque ---> 1972
    1. Although ref to deer ---> think the ones for Godfather prevails ---> 
    2. There is another ---> "2007" ---> year of Phoenix release


Been coding words related ---> forgot the music entry, adding now ---> remember post "black metal cat" + last Tui post
I am focusing only in siris blak (+music)



Etmology research found lot of words on sirius ---> applying word combination btw human and animal forms

At home alone ---> applying code options ---> based on your info ---> trying mix words of sirius
