GM, bro! ---> hope you are going ok <3
Great hints ---> think yoda is clear now
Jun ref too ---> checking albuns 

--------------//-------------
Wait ---> no 5 ---> is it a combo of 5? 
For now ---> lee (Chinese names ---> jun etc) + Gandalf (think Maia / elf names) + yoda (might be "yo" component)
Metal + cat should be another part of the name

-------------//-----------
Been thinking ---> maybe its really a team of 5 ---> even with some anology to lol positions
Maybe a metal ref is missing ---> a guitarist for example
There is more hints that capture ---> boarding now again, Will check it

If this mental construction is not right please tell me ---> i already tried to prompt based on the three characters
Actually, there was some insteristing accounts ---> but don't think so

*Missing <3 

--------------//------------
Hey mate! Everything went ok ---> this is very nice
Met a colleague from london that lives in your area

Trying to find out the Protest the "fucking" hero ref
Will think about it now

The meat refs, including song ---> sometimes it happears
Think that the fortune expression is imp ---> but didnt decoded yet

*ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°

The prompts tried were like leeyodalf / gandyolee --> Lee can also be li and you used that i instead of e
