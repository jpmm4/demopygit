GM;; ---> wake up a bit 'excited' today ---> besides we could not related normal yet, I feel you very close ---> hope you can enjoy it too
Many hints yesterday! ---> but mainly big cat + metal ---> big cat can be a Lion, a jaguar, or other ---> with a link to metal
A lot of talk about lotr ---> with a focus on morgoth, right? 
The third line is CA ---> probably related to big cat

Now dont know where to start ---> resume aot first + search for cat band
