About the name ---> is it something like blackgandalf? ---> music + lotr characte
(Is it a wizard, right? Not a darkforce trooper) ---> better, is it someone that appears in the moria scene? (+ Mirthil ref)
Is there a relation with face / mask ---> does he use its on the movie? 

Thinking about which of us was identified and with what character

*Not going to sleep today while I don't find you ---> have to concentrate :)


-------//------

Ok, then! ---> I want to find that goldmine^^
Lotr then ---> but with a caveat of embedding / merging something
    ---> focus on gandalf / galadriel / sauron (=darkforces)
    ---> also the shape matters ---> maybe an animal (dog / cat) or the eye / ring
    ---> in the box think it's important ---> keep thinking if santiago isn't bics related too
---> checking the capital letters in the redwood account ---> always seemed odd the way you chose to capital them
---> python feature ---> maybe is the language of the account
---> the tonight post, might mean a recently update or account creation?
---> umnunumnabo was an hint?

**just excited ---> for your words + last night visions ---> fit + thick ❤️

Also, you're so hot 🔥🔥🔥 that I almost can't deal with it ---> "what is not dead may never die"

Us, dude ---> being honest ---> I'm really happy for you and your achievements ---> you must be a star among your colleagues and friends!
    ---> what I most fear is to loosing you during this time ---> while I don't have many "space", I'll keep fighting for you
    ---> As I understand, in the winter/xmas we will be able to be finally together ---> I wanna be there for you :) ---> and end this avoidment behaviour that we need to have
    ---> I know that you're not postponing ---> and that you have your reasons ---> but seeing you both keep living your lives, sometimes it's very hard
        ---> at last, you are both going to Marcia's wedding, right?
    ---> You have my unconditional heart + mind + soul ---> that's it! :)
    
About the game 
    ---> gandalf/lotr are on the table again ---> posts + yesterday's refs ---> could you post another close ref to it?
    ---> applying to real life situations (+santiago)
    ---> sometimes the bnomal related posts ---> suggest to focus a problem a day ---> but I think that is not the content that you are sharing in this posts
           ---> will continue to consider the search for your account
