Good morning, bro!! ðŸ¦‹ðŸ’˜ ---> loveddd that twi comment <333
*So, once I have the prescription, think it'll be better to use it in short-term, just to boost to normal serotonin levels. Also, would help to low the addiction to ueed, 
since however it help sometimes, a lot of times just increase my anxiety/depress levels, as a snowball effect. The most direct effect is that I can't sleep, but that's 
normal The roots of my condition are not clear, but will use this space to explore them. Ofc, one of them is the fact that I'm alone and social pressure for not being 
like that. Even before us, that was the main cause of my distress. In the last year, the urs rejection moments triggered deeply these effects (not accusing, just 
comment^^), making my disease evolve and definitly include social anxiety. Everytime I have an event in my agenda, I start to feel stressed as the date approaches. Abt my
body image, I feel proud when I dress right, and I like the way I am, although phisical exercise is important for several matters and I've been procrastinating on going
for a gym. At last, for now, I'll talk to Ptr (dgs), even thow I was thinking to stay here to better recover, but being occupied with smt that I like to do, might help me too. Thank
