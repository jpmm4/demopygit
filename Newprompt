Also, you're so hot 🔥🔥🔥 that I almost can't deal with it ---> "what is not dead may never die"

Us, dude ---> being honest ---> I'm really happy for you and your achievements ---> you must be a star among your colleagues and friends!
    ---> what I most fear is to loosing you during this time ---> while I don't have many "space", I'll keep fighting for you
    ---> As I understand, in the winter/xmas we will be able to be finally together ---> I wanna be there for you :) ---> and end this avoidment behaviour that we need to have
    ---> I know that you're not postponing ---> and that you have your reasons ---> but seeing you both keep living your lives, sometimes it's very hard
        ---> at last, you are both going to Marcia's wedding, right?
    ---> You have my unconditional heart + mind + soul ---> that's it! :)
    
About the game 
    ---> gandalf/lotr are on the table again ---> posts + yesterday's refs ---> could you post another close ref to it?

    ---> sometimes the bnomal related posts ---> suggest to focus a problem a day ---> but I think that is not the content that you are sharing in this posts
           ---> will continue to consider the search for your account
