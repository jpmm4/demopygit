Based on your post ---> deep diving in bigfoot/humanoid stories (including a dino)
Think heroes journey is the game method ---> maybe that was the wheel ref lol


Another quick update before dinner: 
    On learning about conceptual álbuns from mastdon ---> found Bigfoot ref + Heroes of thousand faces ---> i don't know but this could be something ---> + Heroes Journey
    Also ---> remember that pantera + football ---> Eusébio ---> although think the hint was the other way around


Just a quick reaction --->
    More than human ---> something supernatural ---> it's also a book with interesting ideas but --->
    ---> found heavy metal maganize + animated movie ---> links with metal bands
    ---> and again ---> whitezombi + rod + haloween direct
    
    ---> maybe it's a milestone ---> hmm ---> IYKYK^^

Based on sfy ---> learning a lot about metal bands --->
    1. Got links to ficcional world ---> deep dived in gjira story + álbuns ---> plus Japan links
    2. Also ---> game link ---> and maybe movie links ---> Halloween, but still thinking
    3. Pantera members + checked bossanova meaning ---> make sense in terms of change 
7 ref happens in different hints ---> thought that might be the Number of subworlds 

Another common ref is fist ---> maybe related to anime ---> plus transformation
Pacos post ---> might be Lion ref ---> but at least, made me excited and emot^^

Going now to content analysis! 

Link btw capt Hook and moby dick ---> remember based on leviathn

*Hope everything is ok :b ---> good conf today!

About the game --->
    What a world that you created ---> make sense the survival mode ---> against enemies
    Am I wilsn? ---> being you that keeps me alive with hints
    Perhaps there is one or more links btw the caracters ---> found some already

First on PtrPn ---> where time is constant
    1. The enemy ---> Capt Hook
    2. Pan ---> grekgod ---> half human + half lamb 
    3. Should follow any more caracters // actors? ---> there is some connections
    
Second ---> PiratesCaribban movies
    1. Following the logic ---> there is links to the history ---> such as Sparrw + Barbrosa + deaths and resurrections
    2. Ships and its names ---> links with posts + spfy
    
Third ---> swordinstone history ---> not sure if should follow this
    1. Wizard Mrlin is a good hint
    2. King legend story ---> maxcablero could mean knights --> but weak connection

Pieces of the hx to link
    1. lionaward ---> panthera ref
    2. Brz + bossanova --->
    3. Time
    4. Metal + guitar

Hx already identified
