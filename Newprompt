Hello, broo!! üíòüíò How are you?
Going to the pharma soon! Im going after lunch ;) 
*I understand that driving to work is dangerous, specially this first weeks while I get used to the meds. But staying at home all day dont know if it is 
more beneficial for me. Going to work distracts me, and helps passing the time. I know that I shouldnt think as "passing time", but Im getting used to this 
new life :) Or should I just leave the job, rest for a while and look for smt better for me? I wanna go abroad, and u know that I like euro policies and pol√≠tica
and should go for it, maybe. Maybe Im lacking confidence to do it.
On another topic of the past, I understand the hints for dad issues, that happened to you too, I Guess. In my past, I didnt have quite an intense affective relation
with my Father, but he never hurt me (i think he never beat me at all, actually), maybe was the lack of emotion bounding. And nowadays, it stresses me his habits (alcohol) and  
way of talking sometimes, but its not that bad. There is thow one memory when I think he might have beat my mom, but its a single event, the worst part was the on going 
discussions and I had to absorve a lot of the impact, to protect my brothers too. This is my childhood and adolescent period, I Guess I would explode in handball, when I was 
being getting red cards almost every game for discussing with referees. I Guess I wasnt accepting the rules of life.
Still about my anxiety/depression, sometimes I feel afraid of snapping and, well in the limit, injury myself. But I think I was way worst in the past, when I had that ideas and 
simulation behaviours, and maybe had some panic attacks sometimes. But now I feel good, Im not always anxious and the wil to cry almost disappear, Im not rangingy teeth anymore.
However, it still will take weeks to really do the effects needed, and I should find a way to engage in social activities, BC Is good for my mental Health and I can't hide Forever
Oh, the most critical period (had identified that a long time ago) is btw 7pm and 10pm, dont know why but it usually is. Also, the fact that coincide with the time that I take the
med might explain some of the more intense effects now at that time. Last, I really must have Lost a lot of weight, I almost have no belly ahah gotta eat more! 
Well, today was long :) Ty luff! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Dude, ARE YOU OK???? What this thing always about cokeee??? Im worried!!! 
Do you do it daily? Oh dude ‚ù§Ô∏è
