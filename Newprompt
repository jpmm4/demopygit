metal ---> maybe a link with origins ---> home/residence + records ref ---> + spfy
wood ---> tree refs ---> sherman is the biggest one ---> maybe black man means size
    Other meaning for black would be boxer or something ---> but didn't found any link with metal
trying to link with lyrics ---> + geo sites

*might have something more but still ---> can't wait for that whistle!




GM, bro! ---> I was the one who followed ahah ---> my mistake
Ok ---> the main topic that I'm focusing is metal ---> consdering also wood refs, cause I think is part of the code somehow ---> is it a good way through?
Seems clear that is a made up world + awseome ending^^ ---> look forward to check that updates
Metallca album ---> still didn't figure it out ---> looked for cover meaning


*Getting me excited with red refs ---> still on pyjamas
