ah, and still have to check the remainig sfy refs


Think got the idea that this bigfoot/tarzn lead is the way forward ---> maybe merge, remixe and/or search for combinations

The last post ---> think you're telling to explore the intelectual part of this recent discoveries ---> make sense, but I'm figuring out where to begin

*quiz question for you ---> Do you know one of the meanings of falujah in urban dictionary?^^

Hey, mate! ---> Yesterday tried prompts with Tarzn and son ---> exploring if I'm missing something that I should add :)
Maybe was too fast making the transition ---> from bigfoot to trzn ---> checking history and other prompts that could do
