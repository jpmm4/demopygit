Understood that recenter the adventure here ---> so, continues to be for a gith user, right?
Think I caught the hints spanish + moon

--------//-------
Focusing on Owl ---> the etymology sound and your refs + night refs + postcard hp function
Also ---> checking in spanish ---> lachuza myth is interesting
Owlwood ---> lua's song
(the eye movent in GIF ---> very smart^)

--------//-------
Focusing on HP owls ---> considering metal / black ---> hdwig is the most related
Oscar ---> lion award for animals 
Checking the other denominations + real birds that played in movies

-------//------
Been trying different hdwig names ---> 
Also considering other owls ---> black color maybe
