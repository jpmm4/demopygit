Hey! ---> hope you are ok ---> sharing some thoughts first cause you're fucking awseome (\m/)

About life ---> just fyi
   1. Honestly ---> I really feel you and wish I could do something to support ---> I understand the tremendous difficult position that you are in
   2. I usually don't face it ---> but please don't think that I don't care about you both ---> I share the fear of transformation
