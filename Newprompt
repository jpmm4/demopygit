❤️❤️ Good morning, bro! Cooold today ;) hope u had some good rest!
Going for a meeting! after that wanna do some reflections, yesterday u made me think abt professional path! ;))
Also, will talk with the guy to adjust whathever necessary and follow up me ---> woke up a bit more stressed, but I think bc of this meeting :)
  --> think u saw his messages, this way we both feel more secure :DDD
*So, feeling more confortable being meds support by this colleague. Don't know why was a bit shaky this morning, but could be bc need time to make the desire
effects. Actually, the professional path give me some anxiety, but I think it is bc I see so many great opportunities and still don't feel capable to do them and FOMO, 
it's like a vicious cycle. That's why I try to keep assocation activities, too. It's an important effort. Regarding the transformation plan, I understand the tobacco
consequences, but feel it is yet soon to think about that, need a bit more time. Physical activity would help, but procrastination. After dentist, will look to the 
finantial part, bc it's true that I intentionally avoid it and shouldn't. Should I tell my parents? I feel the stigma, not regarding the disease itself, but the idea 
of showing fragility, when my fam usually looks to me as the tourch leader. Specially, my brothers. PS: I will not be tired of thank you for doing this with me, its
incredible!! <333 ---> feeling so much better after saying this!! EHEHE
  --> actually, suimming would be really interesting!! will pass there this afternoon to see the conditions
Hmmm, that thread abt studies programmes was really important!! ---> I'll share abt that later, going for lunch now and then dentist :)
See, Im eating bananas and everything 😜😜😜
Ohh, could I share voice recordings from time to time?? Think would be even better for me! ;) 
Oh, I see, I should do an HIV test and other stds! ---> yeah, this got me worried now, Will take care ASAP! 
Yeah, not looking good! Its part of change process!!
