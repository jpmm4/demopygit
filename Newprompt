GM, bro! What awseome feedback ❤️❤️ ---> woke up ready for coffee^^ and to put my hands and brain into work!
Thanks for the new lesson!! ---> checking the twi hints

Clearly there's a link ---> based on elevens powers + Gandalf/RoP + John Byers (the last name is wrong on purpose, assume)
Uhh ---> feeling close!

-------//------
Is there something related to the isolation tank? ---> exploring the relation with Jon Byers
This links to mind capacities ---> plus killing history part
Leaving Mindelo now to focus on this! Fck yeah 🤘

Ok, how many accounts might you have created?^^ ---> there is a lot of links and interesting readings
  ---> best one is frynpan!
  ---> caught the ref to soap in the updated blog  ---> think might have been you on discord 
Trying to limit the ones that have content for much longer ---> and the characters really look more serious

Is there a final one or the info might be in different accounts? ---> or is one of the codesites?
---> also linking with the hints in stories

*so cool! ❤️❤️
