Is there any link with actors who do the caracters voices?
Found now a lot of child refs ---> think it is intended ---> checking childs in aot




Alright ---> can have more refs, but think you still might be around 
And sry for not consider it so often ---> what will have to go through ---> understood that it will get worst ---> feel you!


Sooo ---> started prompt with Ymr ---> found a strange one but don't think so
Also checked intro of westwrld + hod ---> the blood in the city ref

Should continue on kings lead? ---> based on PT info yesterday (1st dinasty) ---> maybe cross ir with aot 




Before going into aot research ---> sharing one possible interpretation from last posts
1. If apply fstrng function ---> you might mean that you are loosing + except me
2. About brazl post ---> more difficult cause cross ref ---> but could mean that you Will be available?
3. The last One ---> still working on it but maybe listening / emotions related ---> Anyhow, Im just sharing my thoughts, hope don't sound as accusation or other bad feeling ---> I Will always fight for you and wait as needed <3

*While Im talking about other stuff ---> Im shaving today for better looks ---> thinking about your preferences and mine ---> maybe not full, except chest and armpit (sry if innapropriate)


Well ---> home Alone today ---> will now resume searching + listen to our fav music + chill



Hey, my! <3 ---> miss youuu already
Being honest ---> about the following steps ---> really hope that the Next wedding could be the final event ---> I got a bit worried about future scenarios that you were discussing yesterday with Nno ---> looked very convincing and reflected ideas :/
     Also ---> ref to "will get worse" ---> maybe should be prepare for other rocks in the path
Got the point that you will stay here a few more days after ---> really looking forward for that
Finally ---> you are so hoooot! ---> just wanted to grab and eat you all 
One more thing ---> today you are not going to be here, right? ---> cause if you arent, I'll maybe take an invitation from my colleagues

Now ---> lets get back to AoT ---> searching based on your hints yesterday night too ---> should continue prompting, right?
