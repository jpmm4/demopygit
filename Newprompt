*In my new daily journal, I'm trying to find another person to get meds, that be mgf in preference. Think I know already, but let's see. Also, booking that dntal care
for next week, will still need some appointments. Need to do more things, but few steps each time think is better. I'm feeling so much better and really understanding
your presence as my co-partner in this journey! :DDD Last thing, I'm talking to Pdr Leite (my lsbn roommate), and maybe will go do DGS, and not waiting more for the 
other option. If u have any suggestion, feel free ;)
