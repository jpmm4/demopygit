Yes! ---> King Krl frit ---> think it is the one that makes more sense ---> prompting

Well ---> that was a good surprise for today!^^
Been trying some coding but just with the main caracters ---> might be something related with sister or royl famly ---> learning the history! 

The founding One ---> gotta be close ---> Royal family ofc + screaming metal

If understood correctly ---> should continue focus hard on AoT! ---> reading ymr + origins now 
The post about life stages ---> hm, that is what happen in the movie --> maybe has another meaning

Lets go!


Titn is a gold hint, right? ^^ ---> Little vs giant ---> reading the story + refs ---> metal + Queen refs still missing
    Checking caracters + titns ---> lionhart titn
(Remember Monlight movie ---> maybe a bit far)


*Think you had answer, ty <3




Hey! ---> so, what should focus today? ---> an avatar or go for the game? 
Keep thinking about "Little" ref ---> Queen +/- brzil related?
