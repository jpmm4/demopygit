Redwood? ---> found an interesting one but maybe nota


Prompts tried:
Mônca + santa Mônca
Westwood
Sacramnto + Juan + John
Angeles + Los Angeles
Deathvalley + death valley 
Canyon

Top ref ---> meaning forest or mountain ---> Saw a possible hint with sequoia forest ref
       Other possible ref ---> could be more CA north
Twi ref ---> home? ---> SF? Maybe ---> checking map 









Searching now ---> tried LA and did not find yet 
Also trying LA city names and beaches now

Whel ---> meaning location ("residnt") + person name ("human")?



Eheh sounds like I'm on good track ---> 
1. Now trying to find the right prompt ---> looking at map I now see hints everywhere ahah
2. LA ref on video ---> + game city ref
3. Taking consideration for yours valle ref
4. Found a JoaSacra account recently created ---> would make sense --->based on previous new world and future refs

Fcking yeah! ---> it was difficult but finally falling into place;


Just realized:
CA + SFrancisco ---> a lot of saints there + sacramnto ---> vista river + nbask team + pt player
Hot or cold^^

Uk Tui post ---> interp on going:
1. Returning there sooner 
2. Missing as emot
3. Animal related


GM, bro! ---> add "car" + "Audi" + "wheel" + "Santiago" to prompt ---> lets roll! 
(No hidden intentions or escaping ---> sometimes I just get confused, that's it ahah)




Beggining basic questions:
1. Is it the username a woman name?
2. Santiago Compostla is the location or name related?
