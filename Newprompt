Didnt find yet ---> but yhay for today! 


When searching ---> filter by most recently joined ---> checking till may

Based on your feed ---> changed to mordkaiser ---> he is indeed the master of metal
    ---> as you said it's a dual approach ---> might mean that you're the clown and the master of metal
Tried mordkaiser ---> now going to its alias ---> first his name

Just now see the post about foot

----------//----------

Look that might be around this ---> at least, should apply to real life situations^^
Starting prompting now with champ/alias/meaning names ---> beggining with shaco/clown 

---> morde story is actually interesting + pentakill band

Hi! ---> explored the site, rules and hints ---> particularly the facto that Google won't provide me the answer 
    ---> understood that it couldnt be that hard

So ---> does have something to do with clown? ---> Jack in a box pops up
   ---> that was the name that I faceclaimed you during vacations in 14
   ---> wich lead me to LoL ---> mordkaiser / Dr.mundo champs

The post about Lotr today ---> don't fit this theory 
   ---> thibk you mean "refused" (or simple as Gandalf)
