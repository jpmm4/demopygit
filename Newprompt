Hi, bro! Checking your posts now ---> Nice hints!
 
Voldmort? ---> in this 5 characters, clearly there is One from HP
Also ---> spfy hints made me think about this

About heavy metal ---> think would be another hero + baskhero ref
   ---> although there is a link with the e-outfit
Something related to Cars? ---> maybe yours
Whisper ---> understanding as a way of talking ---> yes, a spell 


*Acknowledge that you're not using twi fully, Im just doing it to gain some visibility here + tasks that have to perform in twi

Excelent hints! 
Think maybe referring to human form ---> tom riddle
-----------//----------

In order to help you ---> we have already 3 characters identified ---> Lee+yoda+Gandalf
The other two I think are ---> Tom riddle + Freddy Mercury
Not sure about Freddy but didnt give you time to assess it, too ---> yey! Think there's no doubt about being him

Now, about the fifth character ---> HP link, probably voldmort / riddle
Checking the hints :)
