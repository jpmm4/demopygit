Actually silicon is a metal itself --->
Going through names of liz + wood/metal related words ---> also, seeing black persons ---> that could fit

Interpretation as queen or relative + long ago ---> plus politics ---> + link with silcon valey
The game question ---> this you answer it positively :)
Can't figure out the link with cats ---> think there is something to do with spirits/superstition

Another thought ---> types of metals and woods would make sense? ---> because redwod is one type and you mention chemicals in different posts


*Don't know if intended ---> but you got the band right! ---> could share more singles of the album, if you're on the mood ---> particularly if got another piece of the puzzle right



Myabe the last twipost got also a big hint ---> deconding


Okok ---> let's return to the previous way
most basic meaning for HU ---> is you ---> might be worth it

About the game ---> the idea of a serie of small games ---> that, in the end, culimante in a key answer, make sense?
Based on the journey and posts ---> look like a ficction world with different parts ---> we've been through various areas :)


*been wondering about your wild dreams ---> there is one band that you listen ...^^
