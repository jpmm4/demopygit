Queries that I'm trying ---> beach is central key for user ---> mixing words is important +/- reversing as u did and spfy ref might be imp
Remain user words ---> sand + covas / holes + colors / shapes (aes) 
    inside words ---> galadriel / lort ref + sea / wave / river + resu city + handball
Language ---> trying both, more eng ---> maybe mixing it?
woman refs ---> for beach or for person name or the alter inside as the other example


*Marath ref ---> understood as previous tui_lik badge with same ref


It's really a saint graal quest! ---> ahah
