GM, bro! ❤️❤️❤️

Sometimes think I'm going crazy ahah ---> so, signed up in three games but still figuring out
Questions that I have ---> that could try to answer in one of the coding sessions:
  1. How are you? ---> hope no any major physical problem (mentioning it more than once)
  2. What should I do in the games? ---> My user is DanteGreatDivino
  3. Should use the link for requests?
  4. Personal note ---> will you come only for the weekend or more?
  
Trying to find that changes and datasets ---> starting on fruits

------//-------
Signed up to WD ---> already in forum ---> maybe should contact?
---> it is coded by ele!

-----//------
Trying to figure out the goal now :)---> think it is a chatroom.or something in One of the games, right? 
Found more relations btw characters ---> is a bit weird the posts from 2021, but there might be a reason

Checking spfy! 🤘
