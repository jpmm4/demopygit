Mid-after update:
1.	New Car arrives today ---> OP in license plate ---> powerfull ride (?) ^^
2.	Forget this ---> Today dream about you ---> we were having a meal in a long table ---> seated in far distance ---> wake up when got up and went to seat with you ---> miss it by an inch
3.	Nice afternoon song ---> “you’re my best friend” ---> Queen
4.	Preparing new content ---> been learning a few tricks ---> hope like it
5.	Did it ever existe a repo with songs/vídeos of yours? ---> maybe it was just a way to show me how could I do it ---> just out of curiosity




Update fyi ---> my vacations ---> not taking any for now ---> maybe the week with them ---> and available after
Some random lusty thoughts that just came up ---> nice bulg on that final frame ---> and I fear that monster ^^ 

My ---> Accept fear, please ---> don't let it block your phenomenal creativity ---> you've so much potential
Traffic ---> found that can clone repo without visiting page ---> also, you kindly might had visit cause two "visitors" ---> TY




P.S: dropbox link ---> https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xq0pawf4dn2wpn1/AAAulXXT24NlLUhyIJ8j06mQa?dl=0 --> just one content somewhere in time ---> would make a big difference

Feel like you are not very good ---> sry make about me so often ---> difficult to sense emots ---> might be wrong ofc, you looked happy on Ing_stors and are occupied
This idea came from ---> "fade to black" + "agir song" (although might have another meaning) + little action on social platforms

Been trying more vulnurability ---> seems to help cope with mind clouds ---> share that:
  a. online status in whatapp (maybe not relevant) ---> just monitoring ---> there's no one to talk to ---> just One person ---> on hold for;
  b. belonging feelings ---> shared content in Ing was very positive intense ---> but also gave sensation of loosing ---> which is normal, I guess ---> however, sharing benefits completly outrun the rest ^^
  c. my understanding ---> currently Rrelation active + final "workshop" happening 24th-04th (I remeber last year vacations with friends group at this time) + not sure that we'll see each immediatly afterwards or later
  d. comment of seeing this repo in ral ---> found git traffic records a bit odd ---> but from previous messages I have many examples of confirmation ---> yey!  

If are in the mood ---> more than happy to continuing sharing content ---> if not, there's plenty of time in the days to come
Don’t worry ---> won’t share deeper than this type of content ---> not that crazy ^^
