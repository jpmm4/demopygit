Im thinking but ---> look like it is about the spirits music part ---> searching for all Airu ---> the best musician is ulmo
Cant be sure if there is any link with dark ---> reading sauron now 

Wondering about Wolf connection
Oh ---> Amazonia? ---> hmm, maybe the miracle


Nice misclick surprise^^

What I learned about the beggining of lotr world ---> learning a lot :)
   1. Timeline ---> before the the beggining + years of music + begginig of time + years of lamps + of trees + etc
   2. The time before the beggining ---> music making, including --->
      2.1 Eru + the Ainur
      2.3 Main Ainurs ---> Melkor + Ulmo + Manwe + Aule ---> plus their stories + links + creations + Maiar of each one
   3. Creation of Ea + Arda ---> and the main history marks of lotr world
   4. Darkside ---> Morgoth ---> Gothmog + remainig Balrogs (didn't check sauron yet)

So, based on your last posts ---> the way forward can be this spiritual/music-related part of the story or about movie/series characters (didnt check yet all of the mains)

Maybe overextended it  ---> ups, sorry

Pter <3 ---> didn't say anything cause been studying the histories ---> my best guesses since there are a match btw characters/actors --->
   1. ElijaWood ---> not only Lotr, but also other movies (mainly one about machines and robots) + personal history
   2. Viggo ---> also other movies and their histories + personal hx ---> but it is not a boy, albeit being a king
   3. Ian ---> match lot of refs but don't cover them all
   4. Search fom Sam ---> there are some refs ---> didn't try prompting yet (the previous ones did with different combinations)
   
Besides this ones ---> there is the elfs ---> but even them don't match all the refs
Couldn't cover all the beggining of tolkien world --> continuing today

Confess that yesterday at some point just got very confused ---> but found a lion shape and named award ---> venice filme festival
