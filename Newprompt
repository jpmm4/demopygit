I'm really not making on purpose ---> i spend (gladly) hours each day thinking and trying prompts ---> its a quest that I want to continue for very long time
The only thing I regret is to let you down ---> I don't want to look like a failure ---> hope you understand^^


Off topic: Feeling very jelous now and the rest of night ---> just want to be with you
Will share some content ---> while trying different prompts 




Really want^^

<3 really!! 
Just having dinner ---> resuming ---> many thanks really, i Will find! 
The first ones came from previous research

Death eaters 
Class ---> Emma Watson



Tried: 
Voldmrt
Bellatrx



If continue on HP road ---> thinking about evils group --->Vold and face ref
Also ---> Bella check some boxes


Taking a step back :) ---> got excited ---> expl gradients ahah
1. Checking wrong turn point ---> siriusblak deep history went too far --->
    1.1 linking with infra info ---> figuring out the event
2. Checking how to integrate Rq/ext info ---> leste region +  latv + drink + space ---> on brainstorming^^ ---> vodka brands + bars
3. Voice/mic ref ---> still didnt frame it 






Tried sirsblack and actor name but don't think it would be so direct ---> there is also a link on history --->
   ---> exploring HP love story opt ---> Wolf caracther 
Also ---> trying alias band related

Eheh think Im on it then!! ---> now prompting different queries ---> hope to return ASAP with the account discovery :))



Last post ---> filtering idea ---> maybe to not consider all of them
Following clue that popped up ---> sirs black ---> plus his history + lead Singer band and ear + star name origins + actor name
Yes ---> Blade == sword

Hope getting near^^



1. Assuming that redwod user + challenge game is yours ---> decoding answer ---> clearly personalized ("brain research")
2. First analysis of words and meaning detection ---> movies (hpott + Batmn + 07 + Tarzn) ---> HP might have be the bigger hint
    Sword ref ---> the link on background
3. Anysing today's input ---> music + animes + language + somethings related to Rq / EU /Rus (maybe Erasmus / Rig ) ---> or just for HP fan
4. On integration ---> and making sense of papers shared


*Feeling anxious and really motivated to find! Ahah



Bro ---> sleep a lot ahah ---> resuming searching the final step!! 
An interesting game! ---> yesterday night found some refs ---> voice actor for Batmn would be a nice answer ahah
