Ok, fcking hell lol ---> there's so much info in my head that I'm always pulling myself in every directions 
    ---> and I guess that you are tired of trying to convey the message ---> I know that you are really trying and a lot of times risking yourself, many thanks bro!

Sry for TLDR ---> but to systematize and fyi about the ideas flowing in my head: 

1. The question 
  ---> Lion award ---> don't think it's a real award ---> might be a ref to me, since I'm Lion or a connection to stars
  ---> Faceclaim of the year ---> can be a character, an actor or even someone that we know (talking infra about this)
  ---> 27 ---> dont think it is a year in specific ---> can be the age of someaone or a ref to number of something as stars, movies, etc ---> try all math as 2x7, 2-7, 2+7 = 3x3. 2007, etc
  
2. The context 
  ---> HP ---> being sirius the most obvious and confirmed by you ---> and assume that the link is the brightest star / dogstar / puppystar
  ---> 007 ---> don't know to fit it yet ---> weak link was that James means Tiago ---> and there was a lot of Sntiago refs
  ---> PotC ---> thinking the captain / mariner / sea is the link here ---> Johnny depp could be an answer, but don't see why would you choose it
  ---> Stars everywhere ---> images + text
  ---> little / small ---> trying to apply this to every final name that I come up too, in every sense ---> think the final spfy artist is a ref to this too
  ---> The brave ---> don't know how to fit it yet, but the link might be the answer itself
  ---> Fortune ---> shooting stars are a symbol so might be this link
  
3. Other inputs
  ---> Lotr ---> at this moment I think explored almost the entire basic history and concepts ---> the star of earendil is the best chance 
      ---> plus it is call evening star (appearing the word eve in your posts today)
      ---> there is more conections based on lotr ---> the second strongest is the music of ainur + dark discord <=> metal music
  ---> Cat ---> everywhere and don't think that it directly related to lotr ---> occured me the history of "puss in boots", if it makes any sense lol
  ---> Metal ---> as music, type of metal (mithril) ---> and can just be the black ref 
  ---> King ref ---> so much have to relate to a king or a kingdom
  ---> Brzil connection ---> about the river could also be the Nile (the biggest one and related to alpha canis star) --> but think there is more
  ---> JC ---> lot of refs ---> but also "superstar"
  ---> football refs ---> football stars as example
  
The final answer ---> think "star" is the link behind all
  ---> afraid that could be a name merged ---> but I think you wouldn't do it so difficult
  ---> about people we know ---> weak idea was Mots cause he was the star (of earandil) who did is 27th birthday in NY
  
Will now continuing focusing on stars and its names ---> and prompting
Whenever you want ---> can use this info to better guide me



*Don't think you already left, but hope you're still here ---> going to get some creativity, try to figure this out and think about you;




-----------------------------//-------------------------------------

Found a lot of stars ref ---> plus sirius B ---> little dog / puppy
Writing all the meanings ---> and prompting different ones ---> including lotr refs (earandil)

Cross checking with Lion constellation

Checking again redwood account ---> working on the shooting star ref
  ---> maybe that's the link with gojra song with same name
  ---> also crossing the meanings with lotr + 007
Working too on the question ---> maybe I missed something important ---> still didn't capture the meaning of the number

*and, please, consider my comments about life as my will to change. Not as pressure or something bad, you know I understand and respect 


My interpretation based on high expectations ---> No strings attached ---> meaning a change ---> But, not sure
Also ---> you might feel fine, wich is good ---> can't wait to be with you ---> nothing else matters

Still continue to play and searching your user ---> should, right? ---> it gives me a purpose



Hey, bro <3 ---> How are you?
