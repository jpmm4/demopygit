Been trying the mix of Lee / other names + Gandalf / other names
And that makes some sense --->
There is something more with rings or number 3, right? ---> maybe a third person

Thor is a confounding factor, right?

--------------//------------

Lotr is out ---> can mean Gandalf is Lee (sai-fon) ---> + bird refs and it is a female name
Also Little dragon --->
Checking yin yang ---> sun and moon
 
My doubt now it is only Lee, can would make sense ---> or if should add Gandalf ---> always considering the context and question
Anyhow ---> prompting different combinations

--------//-----------

Alright ---> lets do this ---> if we have a breakthrough 
Designing an interface between both characters ---> checking spfy ---> but noted the reverse pentagram

---------//------------

Revisiting again ---> think posts ref to the combination of both
Checking Lee names ---> + ying-yang martial art ---> black and white, actually

----------//----------

Assuming that you're referecing lotr? ---> + show/HBO + magic + crystal
About bruce/martial arts ---> assumed the back cracking ref, wasn't right?
Free afternoon for this adventure ---> any major hints are welcome

----------//----------

Hey mate 💙❤️ ---> so Bruce Lee + Gandalf?
I enjoy to feel you close so much
