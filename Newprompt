Design three main brunches ---> lotr + aot + metal
Will try to absorve more info ---> and the one just shared got a lot of hints
Boss nova seems important

Getting excited^^ for this afternoon rendezvoux --> see ya soon


Quick update
1. AoT ---> read Eren history ---> cross checking hints ---> tree + powers + Path (void) + classmates
       1.1 should focus on human, right? Instead of the titns themselfs
2. Simalirin ---> watch resume video ---> learn the history + still a lot of info ---> going through morgth specifics
       2.1 is there any specific part I should look into? 

Desgining now the "world" ---> then the bands






GM;; ---> wake up a bit 'excited' today ---> besides we could not related normal yet, I feel you very close ---> hope you can enjoy it too
Many hints yesterday! ---> but mainly bigcat + metal ---> big cat can be a Lion, a jaguar, or other ---> with a link to metal
A lot of talk about lotr ---> ith a focus on morgoth, right? ---> + silmarillon story
The third line is CA ---> probably related to big cat ---> Sant cruz area ---> maybe beach refs ---> black's beach for example

Now dont know where to start ---> resume aot first + search for cat band


*<3 feeling inspired by yesterday memories of yours! ---> heartburning
*Here comes the sun ---> just heard it and wanted to share

Organizing info ---> will come back with some questions :)
