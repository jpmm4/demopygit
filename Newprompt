Alright! ---> three first small answers ---> "rule no3" maybe
Now ---> mix everything:
 1. Siris ---> Padfot
 2. SaintP ---> Rock
 3. Machinehead / blackmore (man in black lol) ---> focusing on guitr
 
 


So ---> Gave a step back ---> looked for albuns released in 72
Found severals links and hints btw artists ---> one interesting album ---> machine head + guitarrist blackmore
Cold or hot? 



Update --->
1. Language ---> ES or ENG?
2. Coding type ---> also trying your user type ---> One + "name" + in + "object" (considering guitar as object)
3. "Name" Word adaptation ---> related to dick, right? and metal ---> using rock/Stone (Saint Petr nicknames + ES variants - roca, piedra, pelota) + Simon
4. Whel meaning ---> still trying to understand
5. Expecting app code inside account




Bro! ---> starting the return trip in a bit ---> today's the day!
Thanks for input ---> rock + guitar + metal + heavymetal + black + (transition words -- in/of/One)






*Blood brothers ---> maybe best maiden song
Based on info --> add guitar_x to prompt, right? ---> rest "hot" ref looks Nice




Hi! ---> been coding and studying the history ---> also linking names btw Jesus (including John) and Sirius ---> Guess that is the way forward
Also, Saint Peter ---> rock meanings 
    Yeah ---> it got to be you! ---> keeper of heaven keys
    Question ---> does it link to Sirius or is independent? 

*Hope everything ok <--> having a missing moment



Yes ---> Jesus story + twi posts + reality ---> a lot of sense
Starting code now ---> Will also cross ref with black just in case


Also ---> considering Jesus ref and hx + down at the disco? ---> year 27 a lot of cross refs
Still trying to fit "Audacty" post ---> 
Answer should have some meaning ---> working on it now 

Actually, considering ---> names Juan and Santiago


\m/

Wood / Woody / dick / cock / bone / boner
Blood / bloody / hard
Black / dark
Pad+foot / Dog / doggy / hound / puppie / wheld 
Metal
Sirius / Man / boy / + star
