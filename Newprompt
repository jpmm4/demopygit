Reading the history of heavy metal ---> between all my notes, I have to find something
Already looked for geographic refs ---> till now, nothing to note 
Really would like to find you ---> albeit the moral consequences, it would be better



Just now remember that I never search for captain jack ---> finding some interesting missing pieces ---> make sense?
Also ---> based of cca post ---> year 27 might be an age ---> more options ---> Jimhendrx died at 27, example
Comrad hint ---> for chernobl serie ---> word meaning ---> blackleafs

The von/van refs ---> coincidence or intetional? ---> if a short-term post with it ---> understand as intentional

Anyhow ---> going to map now ---> been checking history posts

*souvenir ---> two more singles of the new album:

Resuming hard coding ---> getting an history check 

Yes! for hint ---> map exploration
Capturing spfy info ---> black/darg + religious links
Black dead ---> been prompting using black and theblack + words ---> also, thinking about name town+city+word

*you can make suggestions for type of content, if you want lol
*all of this is getting hot + you being hot == lot of heat
(Sorry)


Oh, this last ones are also nice!

Think I got to go to SF ---> + technology ---> heavy metal origins
"lion"hearts ---> machinehed + amonmarth ---> montdoom meaning
Liz ---> maybe a hint for Elizabth as the first user 

The "into site" hint ---> thinking as a geographical place, right?


*Off:also like sexsonds <--- think will be in the mood for more sharing
*Going to be home alone tonight ---> nice for mental space ---> all info are welcome



Beethoven make sense? ---> cross-refs
Also, sandman ---> comic book series ---> dream / death + parents ---> should follow this hint?
about series ---> next message + still working on DianDurte

3 main lines now
  1. HarrPottr ---> sirus
  2. Religion ---> JC / SaintPter
  3. Guitars ---> MCavalro / (RFlynn)


*The song!



hope I didn't cause any disconfort ---> not intended
Resuming coding and writing ---> mixing words ---> using spfy sounds ---> going through band+album+song




Process:
Think ---> game is a fictional world that you created ---> different small stories that are linked by word meaning
Wheel ---> might be the type of game ---> wheel of fortune? ---> came up after seeing one post
Final name ---> made up one from cooking altogehter and probably makes sense ---> sound meaning

ah, making a balance of what learn till now ---> will post here afterwards

Content:
Chernobyl also came up, make sense? ---> a lot of cross ref + plus some led me to BB ---> a song from megadth album ---> actually don't think so
Still figuring out cats + DianDurte + mother refs ---> sure that we will get there
Carpto ---> if it's the name ---> related to tree name ---> lol


*Surprises incoming? (hope I understood right) ---> new album
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109976267/188628866-b6b77dc8-9972-4528-bcf1-47393ecab13a.jpg

Hey! ---> let's continue our research towards a brave new world ---> got really excited yest (emot and physics)
Last nights hipothesis were not to be considererd ---> also remember Joe satrian ---> it's like a remembering journey^^
Mention time calculation? ---> checking 1820s (XIX cent) ---> already did 27 bc/ac
Still thinking in DCarapeto ref ---> can be 1) his last name, 2) jordan/tennis related or 3) fucking will (just kidding) 
Some questions:
  1. Does it include an actor or a movie/serie character? --->
  2. Does it have any relation with Italy? ---> some breaking bad refs could lead to gustavo fring /pollos hermanos / giancarlo esposito + faceoff, as example
  3. What would be the final number of person/names to mix up?
  
  

*Would you like to receive some img surprise? ðŸ˜ˆ ---> don't know in which context you are rn ---> guess that PT center or AT
