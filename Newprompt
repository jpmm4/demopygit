Not sure about the focus ---> tryed Young galadriel + aragorn Young (cursair)
     The last post thing is ref to the music batlle of the ainurs
Amazons mean a female worrier ---> 

Thinking about year too ---> cause think there's math in there




An update ---> searching + posts:
   1. history of Luthien + Beren ---> connected with Aragorn + Awen ---> merge all the blood lines + music links
   2. Also zoology ---> histories of huan (wolfhound) + Tevildo (prince of cats --->linking sauron)
   
Now ---> cross checking ---> little/boy/young ---> plus the other refs


--------------------------//------------------------------


Got "Lost" in the history of dagor dagorath ---> the final battle
Think got the Young ref ---> even if it appears old maybe

Hey, cute <3 ---> resuming the research ---> hope to find you today
Coming back in a bit with updates


Nice, was thinking about soundtrack ---> have to check it
*** ---> wanna shareeee :) 


Not sure about the meaning ---> but I don't interpret as mean :)
   The other meaning is that the character is not evil
Thinking also ---> the black cat + possible game / audio link

Based on King ---> also was thiking about the star ---> earendil think is good start and his stories


*<3 have the best and most awseome teacher


Im thinking but ---> look like it is about the spirits music part ---> searching for all Airu ---> the best musician is ulmo
Cant be sure if there is any link with dark ---> reading sauron now 

Wondering about Wolf connection
Oh ---> Amazonia? ---> hmm, maybe the miracle ---> or ref to the water element


Nice misclick surprise^^

What I learned about the beggining of lotr world ---> learning a lot :)
   1. Timeline ---> before the the beggining + years of music + begginig of time + years of lamps + of trees + etc
   2. The time before the beggining ---> music making, including --->
      2.1 Eru + the Ainur
      2.3 Main Ainurs ---> Melkor + Ulmo + Manwe + Aule ---> plus their stories + links + creations + Maiar of each one
   3. Creation of Ea + Arda ---> and the main history marks of lotr world
   4. Darkside ---> Morgoth ---> Gothmog + remainig Balrogs (didn't check sauron yet)

So, based on your last posts ---> the way forward can be this spiritual/music-related part of the story or about movie/series characters (didnt check yet all of the mains)

Maybe overextended it  ---> ups, sorry


--------------------------//-------------------------------

Pter <3 ---> didn't say anything cause been studying the histories ---> my best guesses since there are a match btw characters/actors --->
   1. ElijaWood ---> not only Lotr, but also other movies (mainly one about machines and robots) + personal history
   2. Viggo ---> also other movies and their histories + personal hx ---> but it is not a boy, albeit being a king
   3. Ian ---> match lot of refs but don't cover them all
   4. Search fom Sam ---> there are some refs ---> didn't try prompting yet (the previous ones did with different combinations)
   
Besides this ones ---> there is the elfs ---> but even them don't match all the refs
Couldn't cover all the beggining of tolkien world --> continuing today

Confess that yesterday at some point just got very confused ---> but found a lion shape and named award ---> venice filme festival
